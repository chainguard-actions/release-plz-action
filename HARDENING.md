Action **release-plz--action/v0.5.129** was hardened automatically. 29 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

The 'Install release-plz' run: step directly interpolates ${{ inputs.version }} into the shell command (`cargo-binstall release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}`). An attacker who controls the `version` input can inject arbitrary shell commands. The input should be assigned to an environment variable and referenced as $ENV_VAR instead.

Locations:

- `action.yml:86`

### script-injection (severity: high)

The 'Run release-plz' run: step directly interpolates multiple inputs.* expressions into shell commands without first assigning them to environment variables. Affected inputs include: inputs.config, inputs.verbose, inputs.dry_run, inputs.token, inputs.forge, inputs.backend, inputs.registry, inputs.manifest_path, inputs.project_manifest, and inputs.command. An attacker who controls any of these inputs can inject arbitrary shell commands. Each input should be assigned to an env: variable and referenced as $ENV_VAR in the run block.

- `action.yml:95`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all script injection findings in actions/hardened/release-plz--action/v0.5.129/action.yml:
1. 'Install release-plz' step: moved ${{ inputs.version }} to env var RELEASE_PLZ_VERSION and referenced as ${RELEASE_PLZ_VERSION} in the run block.
2. 'Run release-plz' step: moved all 10 inputs (config, verbose, dry_run, token, forge, backend, registry, manifest_path, project_manifest, command) to an env: block as INPUT_* variables, and updated all shell references from ${{ inputs.* }} to ${INPUT_*}. This covers all 28 static-inline-injection findings across lines 89, 99, 101, 103, 108, 115, 122, 125, 130, 132, 133, 134, 137, 138, 143, 145, 146, 151, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 163, and 205.
