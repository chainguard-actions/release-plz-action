Action **release-plz--action/v0.5.130** was hardened automatically. 29 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Install release-plz' step directly interpolates `${{ inputs.version }}` inside the `run:` shell command string: `cargo-binstall release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}`. A caller-controlled value is substituted into the shell before it executes, enabling command injection (e.g. a version string containing shell metacharacters or newlines).

Locations:

- `action.yml:101`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Run release-plz' step directly interpolates multiple `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions inside the `run:` shell command string, including: `${{ inputs.config }}`, `${{ inputs.verbose }}`, `${{ inputs.dry_run }}`, `${{ inputs.token }}`, `${{ inputs.forge }}`, `${{ inputs.backend }}`, `${{ inputs.registry }}`, `${{ inputs.manifest_path }}`, `${{ inputs.project_manifest }}`, and `${{ inputs.command }}`. All of these are substituted into the shell script before execution, allowing a caller to inject arbitrary shell commands via any of these inputs.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all script-injection findings in action.yml:
1. 'Install release-plz' step: moved `${{ inputs.version }}` into an `env:` block as `INPUT_VERSION`, and updated the `run:` script to use `"release-plz@${INPUT_VERSION}"`.
2. 'Run release-plz' step: moved all 10 `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions (`config`, `verbose`, `dry_run`, `token`, `forge`, `backend`, `registry`, `manifest_path`, `project_manifest`, `command`) into an `env:` block with corresponding `INPUT_*` variable names, and updated all references in the shell script to use the environment variables instead of inline expressions.
