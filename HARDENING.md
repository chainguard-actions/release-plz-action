## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Install release-plz' step directly interpolates `${{ inputs.version }}` inside a `run:` shell command. An attacker-controlled value for `inputs.version` could inject shell metacharacters (e.g. `;`, `|`, `$(...)`) into the cargo-binstall invocation. Offending line: `release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}\`

Locations:

- `action.yml:89`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Run release-plz' step directly interpolates multiple `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions inside a `run:` shell command block. Every user-controlled input — `inputs.config`, `inputs.verbose`, `inputs.dry_run`, `inputs.token`, `inputs.forge`, `inputs.backend`, `inputs.registry`, `inputs.manifest_path`, `inputs.project_manifest`, and `inputs.command` — is substituted verbatim into the shell script before the shell parses it, enabling command injection. Example offending lines: `if [[ -n "${{ inputs.config }}" ]]`, `CONFIG_PATH=("--config" "${{ inputs.config }}")`, `TOKEN=("--token" "${{ inputs.token }}")`, `FORGE=("--forge" "${{ inputs.forge }}")`, `if [[ -z "${{ inputs.command }}" || "${{ inputs.command }}" == "release-pr" ]]`. All inputs should be passed via `env:` variables and then referenced as quoted shell variables (e.g. `"$INPUT_CONFIG"`) instead of being interpolated directly.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all script injection findings in hardened/action/action.yml:
1. 'Install release-plz' step: Added env: block with INPUT_VERSION=${{ inputs.version }} and replaced the inline ${{ inputs.version }} interpolation in the run: block with the safe shell variable ${INPUT_VERSION}.
2. 'Run release-plz' step: Added env: block with 10 environment variables (INPUT_CONFIG, INPUT_VERBOSE, INPUT_DRY_RUN, INPUT_TOKEN, INPUT_FORGE, INPUT_BACKEND, INPUT_REGISTRY, INPUT_MANIFEST_PATH, INPUT_PROJECT_MANIFEST, INPUT_COMMAND) mapping all ${{ inputs.* }} expressions. Replaced all inline ${{ inputs.* }} interpolations throughout the run: block with the corresponding safe $INPUT_* shell variable references. All ${{ }} expressions now only appear in env: blocks, never in run: blocks.
