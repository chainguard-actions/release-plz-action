## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

The 'Install release-plz' run step directly interpolates `${{ inputs.version }}` into a shell command string (`cargo-binstall release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}`). An attacker-controlled value for `inputs.version` is embedded directly in the shell command without first being assigned to an environment variable, enabling script injection.

Locations:

- `action.yml:97`

### script-injection (severity: high)

The 'Run release-plz' run step directly interpolates multiple attacker-controlled `inputs.*` expressions into shell command strings without first assigning them to environment variables. Affected inputs include: `inputs.config`, `inputs.verbose`, `inputs.dry_run`, `inputs.token`, `inputs.forge`, `inputs.backend`, `inputs.registry`, `inputs.manifest_path`, `inputs.project_manifest`, and `inputs.command`. These are interpolated directly into `if` conditions and array assignments (e.g., `if [[ -n "${{ inputs.config }}" ]]`, `CONFIG_PATH=("--config" "${{ inputs.config }}")`), enabling script injection via any of these inputs.

Locations:

- `action.yml:103`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all script injection vulnerabilities in actions/hardened/release-plz--action/v0.5.130/action.yml:

1. 'Install release-plz' step: Added `env: RELEASE_PLZ_VERSION: ${{ inputs.version }}` and replaced the inline `${{ inputs.version }}` in the run block with `${RELEASE_PLZ_VERSION}`.

2. 'Run release-plz' step: Added an `env:` block with 10 environment variables (INPUT_CONFIG, INPUT_VERBOSE, INPUT_DRY_RUN, INPUT_TOKEN, INPUT_FORGE, INPUT_BACKEND, INPUT_REGISTRY, INPUT_MANIFEST_PATH, INPUT_PROJECT_MANIFEST, INPUT_COMMAND) mapping all attacker-controlled inputs. Replaced all 28+ inline `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions in the shell script with their corresponding `${INPUT_*}` environment variable references. This prevents shell injection via any of these inputs.
