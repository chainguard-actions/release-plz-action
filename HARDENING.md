Action **release-plz--action/v0.5.128** was hardened automatically. 30 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Install release-plz' run: block directly interpolates ${{ inputs.version }} into a shell command: `cargo-binstall release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}`. An attacker-controlled input value is substituted into the shell command string before the shell ever sees it, enabling command injection (e.g. a version value containing shell metacharacters or newlines).

Locations:

- `action.yml:109`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Run release-plz' run: block directly interpolates multiple ${{ inputs.* }} expressions into shell commands, including: ${{ inputs.config }}, ${{ inputs.verbose }}, ${{ inputs.dry_run }}, ${{ inputs.token }}, ${{ inputs.forge }}, ${{ inputs.backend }}, ${{ inputs.registry }}, ${{ inputs.manifest_path }}, ${{ inputs.project_manifest }}, and ${{ inputs.command }}. These are all caller-controlled values substituted into the shell script before execution, enabling command injection via any of these inputs.

Locations:

- `action.yml:115`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Update major tag' run: block in update_main_version.yml directly interpolates ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} into a shell command: `git remote set-url origin "https://x-access-token:${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git"`. Any ${{ }} expression interpolated directly inside a run: shell string is a script-injection finding regardless of the context it reads from.

Locations:

- `.github/workflows/update_main_version.yml:19`

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all script injection findings across two files:

1. hardened/action/action.yml - 'Install release-plz' step: Moved ${{ inputs.version }} to env: block as INPUT_VERSION; shell script now uses ${INPUT_VERSION}.

2. hardened/action/action.yml - 'Run release-plz' step: Moved all 10 inputs (${{ inputs.config }}, ${{ inputs.verbose }}, ${{ inputs.dry_run }}, ${{ inputs.token }}, ${{ inputs.forge }}, ${{ inputs.backend }}, ${{ inputs.registry }}, ${{ inputs.manifest_path }}, ${{ inputs.project_manifest }}, ${{ inputs.command }}) to an env: block as INPUT_CONFIG, INPUT_VERBOSE, INPUT_DRY_RUN, INPUT_TOKEN, INPUT_FORGE, INPUT_BACKEND, INPUT_REGISTRY, INPUT_MANIFEST_PATH, INPUT_PROJECT_MANIFEST, INPUT_COMMAND respectively. All references in the run: block updated to use the env vars.

3. hardened/action/.github/workflows/update_main_version.yml - 'Update major tag' step: Moved ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} to env: block as GH_TOKEN; git remote set-url command now uses ${GH_TOKEN}.
