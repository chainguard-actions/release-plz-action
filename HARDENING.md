## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Install release-plz' step directly interpolates `${{ inputs.version }}` inside a `run:` shell command string. An attacker-controlled value for `inputs.version` is substituted into the shell before execution, enabling command injection. Offending line: `release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}\`

Locations:

- `action.yml:85`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a): The 'Run release-plz' step directly interpolates multiple `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions inside a `run:` shell command string. Every input — `inputs.config`, `inputs.verbose`, `inputs.dry_run`, `inputs.token`, `inputs.forge`, `inputs.backend`, `inputs.registry`, `inputs.manifest_path`, `inputs.project_manifest`, and `inputs.command` — is substituted into the shell script before execution, enabling command injection via any of these caller-controlled values. Example offending lines: `if [[ -n "${{ inputs.config }}" ]]`, `CONFIG_PATH=("--config" "${{ inputs.config }}")`, `TOKEN=("--token" "${{ inputs.token }}")`, `FORGE=("--forge" "${{ inputs.forge }}")`, `if [[ -z "${{ inputs.command }}" || "${{ inputs.command }}" == "release-pr" ]]`.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all script injection findings in hardened/action/action.yml:
1. 'Install release-plz' step: moved ${{ inputs.version }} to env block as INPUT_VERSION, replaced inline expression with ${INPUT_VERSION} in the run script.
2. 'Run release-plz' step: moved all 10 inputs (config, verbose, dry_run, token, forge, backend, registry, manifest_path, project_manifest, command) to an env: block as INPUT_* variables, and replaced all ${{ inputs.* }} inline expressions throughout the shell script with the corresponding $INPUT_* environment variable references. All remaining ${{ inputs.* }} occurrences in the file are now only in env: blocks, which is safe.
