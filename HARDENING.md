Action **release-plz--action/v0.5.146** was hardened automatically. 29 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a) violated in step 'Install release-plz': an expression is placed directly in the run: script: `release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}\`. The caller-supplied version input is pasted into the bash script before the shell runs, so shell metacharacters in it would run as commands. Fix: pass it through env (VERSION: ${{ inputs.version }}) and use "release-plz@${VERSION}".

Locations:

- `action.yml:87`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Sub-rule (a) violated in step 'Run release-plz': the run: script puts many ${{ inputs.* }} expressions directly into the script, e.g. `if [[ -n "${{ inputs.config }}" ]]`, `echo "using config from '${{ inputs.config }}'"`, `TOKEN=("--token" "${{ inputs.token }}")`, `FORGE=("--forge" "${{ inputs.forge }}")`, `ALT_REGISTRY=("--registry" "${{ inputs.registry }}")`, `MANIFEST_PATH=("--manifest-path" "${{ inputs.manifest_path }}")`, `if [[ -z "${{ inputs.command }}" || "${{ inputs.command }}" == "release-pr" ]]`, and similar uses of inputs.verbose, inputs.dry_run, inputs.backend and inputs.project_manifest. Each value is substituted into the script text before bash parses it, so a quote or $(...) in an input could inject commands. Fix: map every input to an env: variable and reference it as a double-quoted shell variable.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Changed action.yml in two steps:
- 'Install release-plz': inputs.version now goes through env as RPLZ_VERSION, and the script uses "release-plz@${RPLZ_VERSION}".
- 'Run release-plz': all 10 inputs it used (config, verbose, dry_run, token, forge, backend, registry, manifest_path, project_manifest, command) now go through env as RPLZ_INPUT_* variables. Every use in the script is double-quoted.

The script works the same as before: it still builds the release-plz arguments in bash arrays, and GITHUB_TOKEN still comes from the caller's environment. The RPLZ_ prefix keeps the new names from clashing with variables the caller might set.

One problem during the work: I made two edits at the same time and one was lost. I noticed it when re-checking the file, redid that edit and confirmed the final file is correct.
