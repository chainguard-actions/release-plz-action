Action **release-plz--action/v0.5.144** was hardened automatically. 29 finding(s) were identified and resolved across 1 iteration(s).

## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Rule (a) is violated in the 'Install release-plz' step: an input expression is placed directly in the run script: `release-plz@${{ inputs.version }}\`. A crafted version value could inject shell commands. Fix: pass the input through env (VERSION: ${{ inputs.version }}) and write "release-plz@${VERSION}".

Locations:

- `action.yml:87`

### script-injection (severity: high)

Rule (a) is violated in the 'Run release-plz' step: many input expressions are placed directly in the run script, for example `if [[ -n "${{ inputs.config }}" ]]`, `CONFIG_PATH=("--config" "${{ inputs.config }}")`, `TOKEN=("--token" "${{ inputs.token }}")`, `FORGE=("--forge" "${{ inputs.forge }}")`, `ALT_REGISTRY=("--registry" "${{ inputs.registry }}")`, `MANIFEST_PATH=("--manifest-path" "${{ inputs.manifest_path }}")` and `if [[ -z "${{ inputs.command }}" ...`. The same applies to inputs.verbose, dry_run, backend and project_manifest. Each value is substituted into the script before the shell runs it, so a crafted value can inject commands. Fix: move each input into an env: block and reference it as a double-quoted shell variable.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Install release-plz: inputs.version now goes through env INPUT_VERSION and is used as "release-plz@${INPUT_VERSION}". Run release-plz: config, verbose, dry_run, token, forge, backend, registry, manifest_path, project_manifest and command now go through INPUT_* env vars, referenced quoted. The INPUT_ prefix keeps them from clashing with the script's own arrays (CONFIG_PATH, TOKEN, etc.) and with GITHUB_TOKEN. The script works the same as before: same arrays, same checks, same flags.
